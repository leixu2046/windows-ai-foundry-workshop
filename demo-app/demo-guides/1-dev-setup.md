# Step 1: Set up your development environment

In this step, you'll set up your development environment to build and run the **Field Report Assistant** app. This is a native **WPF application** designed for Windows Copilot+ PCs. It includes a **skeleton UI** â€” your job during the workshop is to progressively integrate **local AI capabilities** using Windows AI Foundry APIs.

> ðŸ’¡ The UI shell is already provided in this project. Youâ€™ll focus on wiring up local AI features such as OCR, Image Description, Semantic Search, Phi Silica, and LoRA step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure your development environment includes the following:

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the following workloads:
  - âœ… **.NET Desktop Development**
  - âœ… **Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Development**
- [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (or Git CLI) to clone the repo

---

## Open the project in Visual Studio

1. Launch **Visual Studio 2022**
2. Select **Open a project or solution**
3. Navigate to the cloned repo and open the solution: TODO: windows-ai-foundry-workshop/demo-app/FieldReportAssistant.sln
4. If prompted, allow Visual Studio to **restore NuGet packages**

---

## Install or update Windows App SDK dependencies

This app uses **Windows App SDK** to enable Windows-native APIs such as OCR, Image Description, and other AI-related features.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**
2. Under the **Installed** tab, verify that the following packages are present:

- `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`
- `Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts`

3. If any packages are missing or outdated:
- Go to the **Browse** tab
- TODO: which build? Search and install the latest **stable version** of each package

For more information, refer to the [Windows App SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/).

---

## Set the target framework and OS version

1. Right-click the project > **Properties**
2. Under the **Application** tab:
- **Target framework**: `.NET 8.0`
- **Target OS version**: `10.0.22621.0` or later (Windows 11)

---

## Confirm WinAppSDK initialization

In your `App.xaml.cs` or program entry point, ensure the app is correctly initialized to use Windows App SDK. You should see something like:

```csharp
Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Runtime.AppInstance appInstance = 
 Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK.Runtime.AppInstance.FindOrRegisterForKey("FieldReportAssistant");
```

If this is missing, refer to the [WinAppSDK setup guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-project).

## Build and run the app

1. Ensure the **WPF project** is set as the **Startup Project**
2. Press **F5** or select **Start Debugging** in Visual Studio
3. The app should launch and display the **Field Report Assistant** UI, which includes:
   - A file picker or drag-and-drop zone
   - Placeholder buttons for AI actions
   - Output display areas for results

If the app builds successfully and the shell UI loads â€” you're ready to begin integrating local AI features!
