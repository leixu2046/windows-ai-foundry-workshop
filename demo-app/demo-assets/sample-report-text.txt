Foundation Assessment Report

Conducted comprehensive foundation inspection on July 22, 2025, for the East Annex structure. Weather conditions were sunny with low humidity, allowing for ideal assessment visibility. Visual inspection and diagnostic tools were used to evaluate the structural integrity.

Structural Findings:

Discovered diagonal cracks near the southeast footing, extending vertically approximately 8 feet.

Detected differential settlement near the central corridor, with uneven flooring measuring up to 0.75 inches in displacement.

Rust staining observed near metal reinforcement exposure on the north-facing wall.

Loose mortar joints identified in the masonry section of the west foundation wall.

Hairline fractures found radiating from window well cut-outs on the south wall.

Moisture and Drainage:

Moisture meter readings in the utility crawlspace peaked at 22%, indicating persistent dampness.

Existing downspouts discharge too close to the foundation; pooling water noted during prior rainfall.

Efflorescence buildup seen along interior slab edges, consistent with long-term moisture wicking.

Recommend grading adjustments and the addition of downspout extensions to improve runoff management.

Recommended Actions:

Consult structural engineer to assess central corridor settlement and determine corrective action.

Repoint masonry joints with weather-resistant mortar.

Replace compromised rebar areas and apply corrosion inhibitor.

Improve drainage with extended downspouts and regrading.

Seal fractures with epoxy injection and monitor biannually.

Priority Timeline:

Immediate structural review and moisture mitigation within 45 days.

Spring 2026 targeted for masonry and waterproofing repairs.

Semiannual monitoring schedule to begin fall 2025.
